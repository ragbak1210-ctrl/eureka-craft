      <h1>The Clarity X-Ray™</h1>
      <p><em>“Because what you can’t see is what’s holding you back.”</em></p>

      <h2>What it is</h2>
      <p>
        A sharp, diagnostic tool designed by <b>Eureka Craft</b> to help founders
        and teams see the real reasons their brand presence isn’t landing,
        converting, or compounding. The Clarity X-Ray™ shines a light on what
        your marketing team missed—and what your agency never asked.
      </p>
      <p><b>⚠️ It’s not free</b>, because your growth deserves more than a generic audit.</p>

      <h2>The 7 Brand Blindspots We Audit</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Positioning Clarity</b> — Are you memorable, magnetic, and sharply positioned?</li>
        <li><b>Voice Consistency</b> — Can your content be recognized with your logo covered?</li>
        <li><b>Narrative Architecture</b> — Are you telling stories or status updates?</li>
        <li><b>Platform Presence</b> — Are you showing up where your ICP is scrolling?</li>
        <li><b>Funnel Friction</b> — Do curious leads know exactly where to go next?</li>
        <li><b>Founder Visibility</b> — Are you turning POV into positioning power?</li>
        <li><b>Offer Communication</b> — Are your offers easy to say “yes” to—or hard to understand?</li>
      </ol>
