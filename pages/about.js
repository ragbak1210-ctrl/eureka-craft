      <h1>About Eureka Craft</h1>
      <p>
        Eureka Craft is where boring brands become unforgettable.  
        We exist to help founders and teams clarify their narrative,  
        sharpen their positioning, and craft messaging that converts.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Belief System</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>âœ¨ Empathy Over Ego â€” human connection comes first.</li>
        <li>âœ¨ Every Piece is a Craft â€” from a tweet to a strategy deck.</li>
        <li>âœ¨ Founders First â€” we solve identity dilemmas, not just deliverables.</li>
        <li>âœ¨ Inside-Out Thinking â€” clarity before creativity.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Work</h2>
      <ul>

        <li>ðŸ”¹ System, Then Style â€” process first, aesthetics second.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Our Rituals</h2>
      <ul>

      </ul>

      <h2>Our Voice</h2>
      <p>
        Weâ€™re warmly assertive, narrative-driven, and boldly human.  
        Every message we share sparks curiosity, not compliance.  
        Our comms are story-first, never jargon-first.
      </p>

      <p>
        Welcome to the Eureka Way.  
        Craft what converts. Write what resonates. Speak like you mean it.
